## My process

  - Think about the models and associations
  - Think about the business logic, how the pieces fit together
  - Sketch a design that fits the business logic
  - Write feature test for a top to bottom approach for the app creation
  - Coding the API's and the React Components for each feature
  - Seed the application with minimum data
  - Start to style the application
  - For every new feature repeat the process:
    - write test
    - write code 
    - solve problem
    - get the test pass
  - Improve design details
  - Seeded the database with more data
  - Deployed the application to Heroku
